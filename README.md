#  Personal Security System for Night-Time Economy

# Overview
A 6 month long 8-person team project made using Android Studio, Java and the Google Cloud service. Done as part of a 2nd year computer science module at Cardiff Uni.

“Users install an app and give permissions to track their GPS coordinates. The app, when the user so wishes, 	is made to transmit the current coordinates to the central server. In the basic mode, the user sets the “start”	and “end” positions of the intended route, and the system monitors their progress. If the user does not arrive 	at the destination at the expected time, or substantially diverges, the police are alerted. Further, phone’s 		accelerometers can be used to detect anomalies – e.g. fights, rape etc. Travellers with similar intended routes 	could be automatically grouped by the system.”
